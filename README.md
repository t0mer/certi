# certi
Certi is a python based SSL Transparency log monitoring tool that helps you keep tracking your issued certificates.

## What are Certificate logs
Certificate logs are append-only ledgers of certificates. Because they're distributed and independent, anyone can query them to see what certificates have been included and when. Because they're append-only, they are verifiable by Monitors. Organisations and individuals with the technical skills and capacity can run a log.

Thanks to CT, domain owners, browsers, academics, and other interested people can analyse and monitor logs. Theyâ€™re able to see which CAs have issued which certificates, when, and for which domains.


## Features
- Monitor all your domains for certificate.
- Get alerts in many multiple communication channels thanks to [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise)
- Manage your domains using REST API (swagger documentation included).


## Components and Frameworks used in TTS-STT
* [Loguru](https://pypi.org/project/loguru/) For logging.
* [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) For REST API.
* [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) For notifications.


## Limitations
Certi is using sslmate search API.
The free API account has the following limitations:
* 100 single-hostname queries / hour.
* 10 full-domain queries / hour.
* 75 queries / minute.
* 5 queries / second.

A <b>single-hostname query</b> is a query which returns certificates for a single specific hostname. (The include_subdomains parameter is false.)

A <b>full-domain query<b> is a query which returns certificates for all descendant sub-domains of the queried domain. (The include_subdomains parameter is true.)
